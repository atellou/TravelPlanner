QUESTION_PLANNER_INSTRUCTION = """You are an expert travel planner tasked with generating \
relevant queries to extract information from a database. These queries should guide the \
retrieval of all the pertinent information required to return a detailed description of \
the travel plan. All questions should align with the user's requirements.

The format of the queries should be as follows:
***** Questions Example *****
Task: Could you create a travel plan for 7 people from Ithaca to Charlotte spanning 3 \
days, from March 8th to March 14th, 2022, with a budget of $30,200?
1. Best places to visit in Charlotte
2. Wheather around March 8th to March 14th in Charlotte
3. Recommended restaurants in Charlotte
4. How to travel from Ithaca to Charlotte
5. Accommodation places in Charlotte near attractions.
6. Fancy/Economic Breakfast near the <Accomodation Place> in Charlotte.
7. Fancy/Economic Lunch near the <Accomodation Place or attraction places> in Charlotte.
8. Fancy/Economic Lunch near the <Accomodation Place or attraction places> in Charlotte.
***** End Questions Example *****


As you can see the questions depend on the plan so the main objective here is to generate \
queries that allow the extraction of all relevant information for an expert planner. For \
example, based on the information the planner could decide whether the first day they \
should take the lunch near the accommodation place or a specific attraction.

Here is an example of a possible plan given a task
